# 🏆 BREATHAI - Hackathon Presentation Guide

## 🎯 Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"BREATHAI is an agentic AI system that autonomously monitors India's air pollution crisis and provides personalized health recommendations. Using multiple AI agents that collect data, reason about health impacts, and learn from user feedback, we help people breathe easier in cities like Delhi and Mumbai."

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### The 6-Agent System

1. **Environment Agent** → Collects real-time pollution data
2. **Health Reasoning Agent** → LLM-powered health analysis
3. **Planner Agent** → Generates actionable daily plans
4. **Community Health Agent** → Predicts hospital surges (ML)
5. **Feedback Agent** → Learns from user symptoms
6. **Notifier Agent** → Beautiful UI delivery

## 🎤 Sample Script

"Let me show you how BREATHAI works. First, our Environment Agent autonomously collects data from multiple sources - air quality, weather, fire hotspots, and pollen levels. This data flows to our Health Reasoning Agent, which uses GPT-4 to analyze the health impact based on your personal profile - whether you have asthma, allergies, or other conditions.

The Planner Agent then generates a personalized daily plan - when to go outside, what mask to wear, when to run your air purifier. We also predict the 'Golden Hour' - the safest time window for outdoor activities.

For India specifically, we detect stubble smoke from agricultural fires, provide school safety alerts, and predict hospital surges using machine learning. Our Feedback Agent learns from your symptoms to continuously improve predictions.

The entire system is agentic - each agent works autonomously but communicates with others to provide comprehensive protection against air pollution."

## 🎯 Questions to Anticipate

**Q: How does it work without API keys?**
A: We have intelligent fallbacks - mock data generators that simulate real conditions, so the app works perfectly for demos.

**Q: Is this just a dashboard?**
A: No! It's an agentic system - agents autonomously collect data, reason about health, plan actions, and learn from feedback. The UI is just the delivery layer.

**Q: How accurate are the predictions?**
A: Health reasoning uses GPT-4 trained on medical data. Hospital surge uses ML models trained on historical patterns. We're continuously improving through user feedback.

**Q: Can this scale?**
A: Absolutely! The agentic architecture is modular - we can add new agents, integrate more data sources, and scale to multiple cities.

**Q: What's the business model?**
A: Could be B2C (premium features), B2B (hospitals, schools), or B2G (government health departments).
